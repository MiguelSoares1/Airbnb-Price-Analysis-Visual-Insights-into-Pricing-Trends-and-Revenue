### Project Background 
The Airbnb Price Analysis project provides comprehensive visualizations to explore
and analyze pricing trends, bedroom counts, and regional variations in Airbnb
listings. Using Tableau, this project delivers actionable insights into how factors like
the number of bedrooms, zip codes, and revenue trends influence the market. The
dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for strategic planning
and pricing optimization.

### Goals and Objectives

bedrooms.
Regional Insights: Identify pricing patterns across different zip codes to determine
high- and low-demand areas.
Revenue Growth: Visualize Airbnb revenue trends over the course of a year.

strategic analysis.

higher prices, likely catering to large groups or families.

maximize returns.
