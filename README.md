### Project Background 
The Airbnb Price Analysis project provides comprehensive visualizations to explore
and analyze pricing trends, bedroom counts, and regional variations in Airbnb
listings. Using Tableau, this project delivers actionable insights into how factors like
the number of bedrooms, zip codes, and revenue trends influence the market. The

and pricing optimization.
